## Introduction to Express:

* What is a framework? How is it different from a library?
  => A framework is a collection of libraries and tools in support of writing a particular class of applications. It is actual software written in a programming language.
  => The key difference between a library and a framework is "Inversion of Control". When you call a method from a library, you are in control. But with a framework, the control is inverted: the framework calls you. A library is just a collection of class definitions.

* What is Express? 
  => Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

* Why are we using Express? 
  => Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features that you know and love.
